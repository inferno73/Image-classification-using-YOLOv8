You can download the required dataset from this link: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4drtyfjtfy/1

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** **Make sure to remove images 'rain141.jpg' and 'shine131.jpg' as they are corrupted and cause errors during the run.
Make sure that  you have the proper weather-dataset folder hierarchy as this is the main condition for yolov8 to work properly.**
``` 
weather-dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── cloudy/
│   ├── rain/
│   ├── shine/
│   └── sunrise/
└── val/
    ├── cloudy/
    ├── rain/
